    "I did like the `gaussalgo` model's input for a schema which would help the model be able to tell what kind of clauses it could use reliably, like if the datatype is a `date` then it can more easily find out date operations, but if the date column were of the type `text`, then the way it would write the query would be different depending on the format of the text in the column, as we can see from the SQL generated by it for the birthday question, it was expecting the full month name to be spelled out. This model also had other shortcomings compared to our selected model, and that was its contextual understand of some of the questions, i.e. asking who has the shortest name, the model saw `shortest` and put the clause on the `height` column. I decided this model would need more training than our original model and not worth going forward with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other model, `suriya7` is built of the T5 model, much like our selected model, but I was not able to find a way to give it context to the schema/table structure we want to build the queries for, hence the generated query: `SELECT MIN(name) FROM table_name_94 WHERE name = \"` for the question, `Who has the shortest name?`. Right away, this was clearly a sign that this model was going to be more work than it seemed to be worth, not only because it didn't have context on the column names and table names, but the query it generated would have been invalid even if the column name was the correct `player_name`. I also decided that this model was not worth pursuing further."
